    "# Breast Cancer Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "The breast cancer dataset is used to classify breast cancer tumors into two categories: malignant (M) or benign (B). It contains a set of measurements from breast cancer biopsies and is commonly used to evaluate classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes:**\n",
    "  - **Malignant (M):** 212 samples\n",
    "  - **Benign (B):** 357 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Samples:** 569\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality:** 30 features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features:\n",
    "The dataset consists of real-valued features that describe various attributes of the tumors. These features include:\n",
    "- Mean radius\n",
    "- Mean texture\n",
    "- Mean perimeter\n",
    "- Mean area\n",
    "- Mean smoothness\n",
    "- And others\n",
    "\n",
    "All features are positive and represent different measurements of the cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:\n",
    "This dataset is often used to demonstrate and test machine learning algorithms, especially classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and others. It provides a practical example of how machine learning can be applied to medical data to aid in disease diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source:\n",
    "The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is included in scikit-learn's dataset module.\n"
